Allow forwarding to another port on localhost implicitly (by omitting the destination address)
Process and validate ports instead of passing them directly to --dport
Test to see if NAT between LAN interfaces is necessary

Allow multiple --services and --forwards files
Make generated file executable
Write a manpage
Make rc script usage optional, make rc-script path configurable
