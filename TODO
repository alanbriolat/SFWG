Add port overlap checking to SFW.addservice() and SFW.addforward() ?

New config file format:
Forwards :    ports|protocols|iface|destination|destport|description
*   Empty ports = dead rule, * = all ports
*   Empty protocols = * = tcp,udp, else whatever is specified split with ,
*   Empty iface = * = all interfaces
*   Empty dest = 127.0.0.1
*   Empty destport = no port redirect
*   Empty desc = no desc

e.g.        6667-6669|tcp||123.123.123.123||IRCd forwards

Services :   ports|protocols|iface|from_ip|from_mac|description
*   Empty ports = * = all ports
*   Empty protocols = * = all protocols
*   Empty iface = * = all interfaces
*   Empty from_ip = * = no restriction
*   Empty from_mac = * = no restriction
*   Empty desc = no desc

e.g.        ||_LAN_|192.168.0.2|00:00:00:00:00:00|Allow all from foo on LAN

Placeholders:
*   iface
    *   _WAN_ - all --wan interfaces
    *   _LAN_ - all --lan interfaces
