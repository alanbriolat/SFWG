Process and validate ports instead of passing them directly to --dport
Test to see if NAT between LAN interfaces is necessary
Move /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward check to depend on --execute option - can generate firewalls on machines not using them!
Make generated file executable
Write a manpage
Make rc script usage optional, make rc-script path configurable
Test ICMP rate limiting

Add port overlap checking to SFW.addservice() and SFW.addforward() ?
